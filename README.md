Detecting Frauds with Logistic Regression

Fitting a Logistic Regression Model to a dataset with the aim of predicting wether a transaction is fraud or not.

This file is inspired by a few Data Analyst Nano Degree classes.

The Logistic Regerssion is a methodology used to predict the value of the dichotomic dependent variable Y, 
based on a set of explanantory variables, which could be either quantitative and qualitative.

Y is the qualitative response, which describes the outcome of a random event X. Y can be 0 or 1.

In the following project, we are going to analyse a transactions dataset, and analyse wether their duration 
and day of the week they were made have an effect on the likelyhood of turning out to be a fraud.

In order to fit the Logistic Regression we will be first using the library statsmodels, then the library scikit-learn.
